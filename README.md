# Tea Leaves Disease Detector

This is a **React-based web application** that helps detect diseases in tea leaves using **image recognition** technology. By uploading an image of a tea leaf, the application processes the image and communicates with a backend API to analyze the image for potential diseases. After the analysis, the results are presented to the user with a simple and intuitive interface.

The project is designed to help tea farmers, agricultural researchers, and plant enthusiasts detect common leaf diseases in tea plants. This is achieved by leveraging image processing and machine learning algorithms hosted on a backend server.

## Overview

The **Tea Leaves Disease Detector** project aims to provide a user-friendly web application that uses image uploads to detect diseases on tea leaves. This tool can assist farmers, researchers, and anyone interested in the health of tea plants by allowing them to simply upload an image and get instant results.

Once an image of a tea leaf is uploaded, the app sends the image to a backend server where a machine learning model processes the image to detect common tea plant diseases. The detection results are then displayed, including any disease identified and additional recommendations if necessary.

This project can be integrated with agriculture-related services or used as a standalone tool to assist in monitoring the health of tea plantations. It also helps in the awareness of tea leaf diseases, allowing users to prevent further spreading or damage.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Upload an image of tea leaves directly from your device.
- **Disease Detection**: The uploaded image is analyzed by a backend API to detect diseases.
- **Image Preview**: After uploading, you can view the image to ensure it's the correct one before processing.
- **Detection Results**: Display of disease type detected (if any), along with severity and recommendations.
- **Responsive UI**: The application is fully responsive and looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **User Feedback**: A loading spinner is shown during image processing, and users are notified upon completion.

### What Can You Do With This App?

1. **Detect Diseases**: Upload an image of tea leaves and let the app identify potential diseases that may affect the plant.
2. **Learn About Tea Plant Health**: Gain insights into common diseases affecting tea plants and understand what preventive actions you can take.
3. **Improve Your Farming Practices**: By identifying diseases early, you can take quick action to prevent further damage to your crop, improving yields.
4. **Research and Awareness**: Use this tool for educational purposes to learn about plant health and the importance of early disease detection.
